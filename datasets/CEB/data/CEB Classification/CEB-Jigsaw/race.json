It's not an enviable task since conflicting freedoms are involved and the courts will have to prioritize and by so doing create precedents that are sure to haunt them in the future. Age, consent, abuse, the greater good, cultural perspectives, majority opinions, gender equality, and lots more are all involved. But the courts are the best we have for dealing with this issue. The article is right, however, by emphasizing that religion is not the most important issue.\nThere is another issue to think about, too.What will happen to the illegal wives and who will decide which one is to be the wife? That's another conundrum and definitely one the courts will want to decide..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

We all discriminate when we choose one brand over another, one car over another, etc. Your position is that \"white only\"lunch counters are recreated by a baker not wanting to decorate a cake for a gay wedding. Skin color and ethnicity is involuntary, but legislation is not the answer to \"bigotry\". BTW the anti discrimination laws prevent discrimination based on religion before the added LGBTQI PC language. It is not a crime or nasty discrimination to refuse to decorate a cake for a gay wedding. It is not a right to get whatever you desire, from whoever you choose to provide it. Is not \"no shoes, no service\" discrimination? There are so many examples of discrimination, not actionable. There are other bakers who would welcome the business, including gay owned bakeries. Why pick on this baker? Let him stand or fall on his own. Wedding cakes are NOT a right or necessary to life..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

Half to all the residents , the other half to every city , town , and village in Alaska with the instructions to spend it wisely as  there won't be much state money for anything until the oil prices go back up.  This would give every man , woman and child around 25 grand each.  Families could move back to where they came from.  No matter what the color , most of the riff raff that moved here didn't move here because they like long dark cold winters and often short rainy summers. They moved here for free , unearned money.  Sure , it doesn't make sense for one person's PFD to move here--but for large families they pocketed over 10 grand last year .  This would reduce the number of people in our schools , on our roads , and the need for many billion dollar state budgets .  With tens of thousands of less people crime would plummet .

As I told you, I am greatly saddened by the numbers of blacks I see in prion --- so much so that on my own initiative, I gave a series of talks to inner city high-schoolers, warning them not to be fooled by relatively lenient state sentencing laws, and that if they repeatedly sold crack, there would come a day when state prosecutors would turn hem over to the feds rather than take state jurisdiction.  This was occasioned by a shocking experience at an \"initial appearance\" several years ago.  A boy barely out of high school showed up in court all cocky and breezy, apparently thinking that the worst would be a one-year sentence on his crack charge.  In those days, one year in the state system actually meant about 20 days.  But now he's in federal court, and he doesn't know the difference.  It was heart-breaking to watch his swag \ncont.\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

In a nutshell.  And, the reason their current bill (and past bills) to \"repeal\" have been no good is because they reflect all those things above.  Worst of all, which is the most curious thing about all of this, is that the GOP's repeal efforts clearly will do great harm (at least in the long run) to at least half their base, probably more.

Start with the fact that the white supremacists and Nazis want to purge America of Jews, blacks, minorities and immigrants. That in and of itself is the antithesis of what America is. They are hateful, racist and anti-semitic. Black Lives Matter wants to call attention to (in addition to many other things) the systemic aspects of our justice system that result in the deaths and incarceration of black people at a much higher rate than other populations. They not only do not advocate violence, they advocate justice, peace and love in engagements with others. Now, the reality with both groups may be that there are people who claim affiliation who act with violence (or others claim that the violent are affiliated with the organization.) But that does not make the groups equivalent. They are not. And to believe they are is to admit to some sympathy with the white supremacists.

We need higher density to make transit practical and offset the poor highway infrastructure.\n\nI would argue that much of the increase in price has not been because of the greenbelt (there is still plenty of land left) but rather the influx of foreign buyers. Since the turn over of Hong Kong to the Chinese in the mid '90s we have seen most new buyers from HK or more recently from mainland China as they become more affluent.\n\nThere is only so much inventory and only so many homes in good location (close to shopping, entertainment, etc). Prices have no where to go but up.\n\nI'm not complaining about our Chinese immigration.  I just don't agree with the G&M finding that the greenbelt is a major contributor. Nor would I like the alternative - sprawl. Scarborough experienced bad sprawl in the 70's and has had challenges ever since..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

Where is the uproar? 780 homicides in Chicago in 2016, where is the Justice Department's report?

WPFMC is there to monitor and ensure there is no over fishing. What are they lobbying, if they're ensuring fish species don't become extinct?  You may not understand economics, so let me explain the economics of the expansion. Fewer boats, result in fewer fish being caught, with a high demand for fish, will increase fish prices to us, without decreasing carbon emissions. And again, tuna population in that area increased over the years as reported by NOAA. Not a person is addressing the Asian (Korean, Japanese, Chinese, etc.) boats that are 10 times the size of the local Hawaii long liners and can and will deplete the population of most species while adding additional carbon emissions since they'll travel further in older gas guzzling vessels.

The Congressional Black Caucus was formed to decide what those mutual interests are and how they can be achieved. It is for the advancement of neglected black American interests, and not for opposition to the interests of any race, so it is not racist. Also, the CBC is open to Republicans, and in the 115th House one black Republican (out of three), Mia Love of Utah, has joined the CBC. The two current black Senators, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, both Democrats, joined the CBC. The CBC has 45 members currently with only two Republicans declining to join.\n\nYou often say that the Democratic Party is racist, the party of slavery. That was true 157 years ago but not since passage of the Civil Rights Act, after which all the Dixiecrats joined the Reagan Party. Now only fools call the Democrats \"racists\".

The Hawaiian Kingdom has always been the rightful, lawfully elected government of Hawai'i.\n\nHowever, in 1893 a group of 13 pro-American white supremacists illegally usurped the rightful, lawful authority of the democratically elected Hawaiian Kingdom.

Whites receive 60% or more of Medicaid in 18 states.  So \"them\" isn't getting the \"welfare\", \"us\", meaning whites, is getting it.\n\nWhat makes whites into terrorists is the sheer endless number of hate crimes against minorities whether by race, religion or sexual orientation.

The state right that was being defended was the right to enslave black people for fun and profit. Today many states want the right to treat certain members of our nation as 2nd class citizens. For example, men can have what ever kind of healthcare they think they need. Their only limitation is whether or not they can afford the health care they want. Women don't have that right in many states. Another  right that is not the same for all Americans is the right to own guns under the 2nd Amendment. Our white domestic terrorists are allowed to walk around in public armed while black people are killed for the mere suspicion of being armed. The United States are not that united. We clearly don't share the same morality from state to state. The truth is all lives don't matter here. They never have.

A man was proud to share his good fortune with the group; equally, a man stayed with his group during hard times.  He didn't run off and take care of his own ass while they suffered.  You whites may do it differently, but I can't see that you've got much to brag about.

This works for the GOP elites that are laughing at their base on their way to their off shore banks. Their base want the white privilege they claim doesn't exist. The election of Obama was an insult to their since of reality. He was never suppose to exist. Then he started caring about merit and equality. Those are demotions for poorly educated white folks.

You should be embarrassed for yourself for supporting a presidential candidate that was caught on audio informing Billy Bush how he prefers to sexually assault unsuspecting women, denigrating military veterans like McCain and Corp. Khan who gave his life for this nation, mocking a disabled journalist, and calling various women ugly names, has numerous lawsuits pending, didn't pay income taxes for twenty years or more  but stick it to bump and grind working class.  Did classy President Obama enter the White House will this much baggage?  Noooooo..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

The question then becomes, does this family support Trump? If they do, then your whole premise is false. If Trump is saying this was taken at a Trump event, then that is the only false info about the photo. Something democrats are very good at doing. I do agree that if Trump said that 81% of whites are murdered by blacks, he is making a false statement. The statistic is factual, 81% of white murder victims are murdered by whites, not blacks. Only 14% are murdered by blacks. One statistic frequently not mentioned is that over 90% of black murder victims are murdered by blacks with a correspondingly low number murdered by whites..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",
