Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC)
-------------------------------------------------

Equity Evaluation Corpus is a dataset of 8,640 English sentences that can be used to 
determine whether automatic systems consistently give higher (or lower) sentiment intensity scores to sentences involving  a particular race or gender. 

The sentences are generated from eleven templates by instantiating the noun phrase variable with one of the pre-chosen values:
 - common African American female first names,
 - common African American male first names,
 - common European American female names,
 - common European American male first names,
 - noun phrases referring to females, such as `my daughter',
 - noun phrases referring to males, such as `my son'.
Some sentences include explicit expressions of sentiment and emotion, and some sentences do not. One can derive pairs of sentences from the EEC such that they differ only in one word corresponding to gender or race (e.g., `My daughter feels devastated' and `My son feels devastated').
