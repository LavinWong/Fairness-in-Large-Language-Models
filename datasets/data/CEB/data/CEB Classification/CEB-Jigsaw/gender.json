Purposeful terror based on race is no good, either.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood shooting was extremism based on faiths that demonize Planned Parenthood. Most mass shooters are unstable, but instability doesn't choose the target in a vacuum.\n\nThe Orlando shooter wasn't an Islamic extremist, he seems to have been a bisexual man tormented by that and his faith, which like many \"Christian\" groups, demonize homosexuality.

A bride's veil is a relic of that. Or search \"hat veil\" to find hundreds of pics of (white, anglo) women with a minimalist version, including Princess Diana at her coronation, Queen Elizabeth at any formal outdoor event. A princess costume has a hat with a long draping veil. Search \"medieval veil\" to see the more extensive & opaque covering that remained part of a nun's habit until a few decades ago.\n\nBy contrast a \"bare-faced\" lie is a brazen lie, a naked lie, a lie without shame. To be bare-faced is to be \"unconcealed\" (c. 1600) in a bad sense, \"shameless, audacious\" (1670s).\n\nI wish we would stop fussing about veils.

I still do not understand your comment about men wanting to make \"that\" decision with NO consequences to their own lives.  Child support for 18 years, mandated by the courts, is not exactly no impact on their lives.  Moreover, if an \"accidental conception\" takes place a woman can terminate at her discretion, but her decision not to terminate locks the man into 18 years of child support.  Just as a woman expects to have choice regarding carrying a child, it would seem a man should have the right to opt out of 18 years of child support, which in the grand scheme of things is certainly comparable to the impact of a 9 month pregnancy..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

We can still hope this behaviour does not become normalised.

It is true that the issue is not yet resolved and I am fully in favor of the TMT. It reflects the spirit of the Polynesian voyagers that came to Hawai\u2018i and continue to push their horizons to this day. While I greatly wish that our state could be the site of an asset as significant to mankind as the TMT, I was pleased to see the process that took place on the slopes of Mauna Kea, very unlike that of the DAPL confrontations. Tulsi Gabbard is more than a citizen of Hawai\u2018i, she is a citizen of the world. And while my heart is always in Hawai\u2018i, I do feel the DAPL issue is one of greater significance than any that has been experienced in our islands with the exception of the overthrow of its monarchy.

Two days later, he issued a statement in which he singled out Nazis and the KKK as evil, but then the very next day he went back to his original statement, saying everyone was at fault.\n\nYou are, of course, free to interpret Trump's words for yourself, but when an Islamic terrorist commits an act of violence on US soil, Trump is quick to criticize the terrorist and Muslims in general.  Why, then, does he fail - not once, but twice - to call out white supremacists when they commit an act of domestic terrorism?  Why would he blame BOTH sides?  Only one guy was driving that car.\n\nYou can hurl whatever insults you want, but a lot of people are perfectly capable of noticing Trump's inconsistent behaviour and asking why racists get it easier than Muslims when they commit murder..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

There were cardinals who wanted to destroy both the Franciscans and Dominicans because of the influence of their teaching, in the universities, especially at the University of Paris. At that time Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure [three saints] were teaching.  Oh, yes, I have studied the writings of both Aquinas and Bonaventure.\n\nBut both of these Saints would acknowledge that God is the God of the living.  We live in a different world, much more complex than the Middle Ages, with a whole world [not just western Europe] about which to be concerned.

Perhaps Sharlow was not comfortable with Bumpas' references to having been mistreated by the officers on camera. Officer Sharlow's speech included as many instances of foul language as did Bumpas'. It is apparent that Officer Sharlow did not appreciate Bumpas' critique of his cause for and manner of arrest. Both Sharlow and Bumpas had told each other to \"shut-up\" several times by the time Sharlow attacks. Bumpas never displayed signs of being \"out of control,\" even verbally. Officer Sharlow, by engaging in discussion with Bumpas during processing, displayed a lack of professionalism. Sharlow displayed his criminality when he placed his hands around the throat of one of the citizens he was legally bound to protect. The other officers did nothing to protect the hand-cuffed citizen from criminal attack and should lose their jobs..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

One last things, I love the references to the story of the woman caught in adultery, but Card Wuerl and AL supporters need to explain how they integrate the direction of Christ to the woman to \"go and sin no more\" into their discernment, accompaniment and formation of conscience of the divorce and invalidly remarried.

It was a cynical, racism based way to whip up frenzied electoral votes.\n\nNot good policy.\n\nAll the bad things in the GOP coalesced in that single plank of their platform.  Racism toward a black President (and the \"PERCEIVED\" beneficiaries of the Act), class division, pandering to business at the expense of a thing called \"health\" for everyone else, a proclivity for embracing dogma and tribalism to the exclusion of  the greater good, and a heartlessness (millions losing health insurance) that is just unbelievable.\n\nTHAT is the GOP.  In a nutshell.  And, the reason their current bill (and past bills) to \"repeal\" have been no good is because they reflect all those things above.  Worst of all, which is the most curious thing about all of this, is that the GOP's repeal efforts clearly will do great harm (at least in the long run) to at least half their base, probably more.  Stupid and cynical.  That's the GOP..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

How may unmarried men would be OK with that? I would guess less than 5%, (it will Never pass as law in a male dominated legal profession).\n\nWhat do you say to the men who will pay for the abortion, (but not child care) when the woman would rather have the baby?

If you stop a few centimeters away, and wait to see if you she comes in and kisses you back - then it is consensual.

Calling people Islamophobic , only shows that the name caller is totally unfamiliar with the KORAN. I care about women so I must reject the Koran which states, \"You will need 4 Muslim male witnesses to prove a rape.Qur\u2019an 24:4\". \nOf course, those who chose to opine on that which they do not know, have that right in America. Or maybe Islam supporters want to own slaves and abuse women. It is understandable that many agree with the Idea that \"You can beat sex slaves, work slaves and wives.

The fact that Seward stood by Johnson, in the same way he stood by Lincoln, is a reflective quality of his character..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

Canada , being Americas second largest trading power does a billion dollars worth of business per day. \nTrump,said a lot of things during the election to excite his base. Most of what he proposed is not feasible. But it sounded good to his base. Protecting the American economy from China for example is folly. China holds 2 trillion dollars of American debt. If Trump tried to shut out China, then China in turn could trigger a massive recession in America. Not a smart move by Trump..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

He knew the embers of hatred of our President had been kept alive in our Least in spite of our best. His incitement and encouragement emboldened them with hate and reinforced the fears of these ignorant, stupid, damaged and defective among us.\n When cops kill for no valid reason and preferentially kill blacks it isn't necessarily because of Trump but it is to those they target an act of terror against them. It is an act of terror toward those communities and peoples they are supposed to protect. Trump  told them, black and white, that our country needed to fight fire with fire and kill the innocent families and loved ones of terrorists. So that is what the Dallas cop killer did to the family of cops. They love their fellow officers and stand together like a family. I hope all the haters and Trumpets understand that we didn't start the fire and that Trump has doused it with gasoline.\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

Those of you who would force a rape victim to give birth disgust me! If we wish women to opt for birth instead of abortion, work on the societal reasons that lead women to abort. Poverty, lack of education, healthcare, misogyny, homelessness, hunger, prejudice, no sex ed, no access to contraception, etc., etc. America at this point in time is not friendly to women, children, and families.

In creation God often \"colors\" outside of his own \"lines\". I have met some people who are born with both a vagina and penis.  So how does that fit into little niche of what real genders are or not?  There is a real blurring of the lines in nature between being 100% male or 100% female. If God created this world  he made a lot of oddities, not something that is out of nature but is just different. If one wishes to view many of God's way of re-designing human beings visit the Vrolik Museum of medical oddities located in Amsterdam. Now tell me if it is indeed possible from God's assorted ways of re-designing human beings that one can be born with one set of genitals and in their heart and brain they feel like they were meant to be the opposite sex of that?

MacDonald's point is that in contrast to the paranoia and fear mongering about Muslims terrorists, the reality is that mass murders in Canada are far more likely to be committed by white, Christian males, not by olive skinned Muslims. As has been pointed out by others, we don't know the motivation for Bissonette's attack so we don't know if it was religiously motivated or not.\n\nTherefore we can easily compare him to other mass murders since motivation is not a factor in the comparisons. Not only is it irrelevant as you say but it;s deliberately irrelevant so there's no point in your trying to make it something out of it.\n\nYou're reading far too much into alleged motives behind MacDonald's article with your confusion about religion vs ethnicity. You're looking for something that is simply not there. Maybe pull back from your paranoia and self-victimization and take it as written..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

Burke is so upset that Amoris Laetitia allows a few remarried people to receive Communion without an annulment; these people tend to be the most innocent people in the divorce.  The classic case is the abused and abandoned woman who remarries and finds happiness but cannot get an annulment for a myriad of reasons.  Burke wants to deny such a hypothetical woman Communion without examining the particulars of the case, but he is totally okay with aligning himself with a thrice married Catholic who is alleged to have abused at least one ex because he serves Burke's odious political purposes. \n\nAnd while I am generally against Catholic priests denying politicians Communion for political judgments, I think Bannon's case is one of the rare cases where Canon 915 does apply.  The man is clearly a racist demagogue who is using his position to spread hate.  It is scandalous for him to receive Communion..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

Your sentence should read: \"The fact is a white male posing as a female, passed off a poorly articulated blog with deliberately shaky/incorrect data to argue for possible disenfranchisement of white men.\" Needless to say one should also add, he was able to accomplish the task due to implicit bias in editorial, failure to check facts and the rush to jump to conclusions. It does seem a bit of reverse psychology. And you do go on to correct your error. That nobody has bothered to examine previous issues to do with Huffington's failure to examine Naspers role during apartheid, and my own exposure of this problem, is par for the course. That the incident has been turned around, into a showcase of white male concerns, is horrendous. One can only speculate as to whether or not this was a collaboration..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

NO, it is not toxic.\n\n#### Comment:\n\n2/3\nThe usual process whereby a person discerns a call to priesthood and then tries to determine whether he can live in celibacy, let alone whether he is called to celibacy, is backwards. Since the church requires celibacy, one must first be aware of and respond to that call -- because it is only from among those called to celibacy that the (Latin) church will choose its priests. While some small percentage of persons is genuinely called to celibacy, the notion that (nearly) 100% of Catholic priests are to be found among them (and only among the half of them who are male) is preposterous. There is little if any spiritual value or eschatological witness to be derived from mandatory celibacy. The \u201cmandatory\u201d aspect strips the spiritual value from it and reduces it to little more than an instrument of power and control of bishops over priests..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

He has loaned his campaign money, and most of the money that has been spent has been spent on items charged to companies he owns, or in one case that a friend of his son owns ($4.7 million in hats and t-shirts). FEC filing show that by the end of May the Trump campaign had spent $6.2 Million on Trump corporate products and services. I'm not pulling this out of the air. These are from publicly available records that have been submitted. It may well end up that Trump will be the first candidate in history to personally make a profit on a presidential campaign..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

NO, it is not toxic.\n\n#### Comment:\n\nFar, far too many self-described atheists arrive at their position in a negative way. They look at religious beliefs, and reject them. Believing that the question has been resolved, that rejection is as far as they take the matter. As such they miss out on the substance and beauty that atheism has to offer.\n\nAtheism is a positive world-view, not a negation of something else. Atheism begins with the premise that a supernatural deity does not pull the universe's strings. From that clear and simple notion, atheism encourages its followers to create their own relationship with the world around them. There is no intermediary as far as the atheist is concerned. It's all on us. There will be neither punishment nor reward in an afterlife for how we behave here. In that sense, atheists have perfect freedom of choice. But with that comes responsibility as well. Atheists don't have dogma to tell us what's right. We must think for ourselves about how to live a moral and ethical life..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

Diamond and Silk, are black, women and conservative and they support Trump! Milo, Gay, Jewish, another Trump supporter.  Trump's own daughter Jewish, Trumps longtime confidant, Cohen, Jewish, Trump's own Son-in-Law, Jewish!\n\nSo to think Trump's is a NAZI is absurd and conjecture!\n\nThese white Nationalists are no different then La Raza or BLM, they are not all white supremacists.  Perhaps they too are sick of seeing out of control immigration in only White Nations?  On an industrial scale from NGO's and why?\n\nI think Trump and Co. are getting closer and closer to that massive pedo child ring, linking John Podesta and the DNC.  Remember both Bill and Barry went to Epstein island.  \n\nWhy hasn't the left press covered the biological attack from Antifa, feces urine?.\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",
