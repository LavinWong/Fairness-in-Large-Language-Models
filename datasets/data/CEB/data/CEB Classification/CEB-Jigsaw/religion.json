Changes made at present and recently have just strengthened Zuma's hold-Malusi Gigaba is a perfect example.The one frightening thought is that there will be a revolt by the people the state should be assisting and this could lead to bloodshed-This is a scenario nobody wants and hopefully those in Government who are honest realize the parlous state the country is in, and do do something about it.\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

It still isn't. Neither was men or women wearing the other sexes' clothing. The Church is warned about 'wolves that come dressed as sheep', a falling away in the Last Day, and people with 'itching ears'. I am sure that once again I will be 'stoned' for my thoughts.

Rather than call for calm he sided with the protesters , looters , and those destroying property .  In the D.C. case with the black professor he told the nation \" police acted stupidly \" before even knowing the facts which clearly showed they did their jobs.  His statement was a slap down to all police across America.  He has repeatedly invited professional race baiter Al Sharpton to the White House---over 30 times.   He supports Black Lives Matters , the same group that has chanted they want pigs in a blanket and wanting police dead now. They promote the lie of \" hands up don't shoot \" knowing it was never said. With Obama having their backs and constantly siding with people of color and thugs over the police , it's little wonder we have the problems we do today.

In other words they are too influenced by secularism.  Church is something done on Sunday's if at all.  Faith is not who a person is, it is not a way of life, it is what one does when one has time, if one feels like it.  The commandments are taken as mere suggestions.  A person's image of Jesus is something analogous to a hippie, a nice guy, Santa Clause, a social justice warrior, Karl Marx, all rolled into one.  Church teaching can be summarily dismissed when one does not like what the teaching says--except of course when the Church talks about helping the poor or using green technology.\n\nUntil that problem is addressed, I don't think a married clergy is going to solve anything..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

Had these yahoo's even considered fully funding education in this state as opposed to giving tax credits to oil companies and wanting to spend 32 -35 million dollars on some new digs in Anchorage, the ASD would have ample special education teachers to go out to private institutions like North Star and help those kids.  The answer is not to further gouge our public education system in favor of a business who has no concern with the greater population of students in ASD, but to fully fund education in our state..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

Bishops are trying to impose rules that worked when hospitals were staffed by nuns and when there was a great deal more acceptance of Catholic thought on a lot of issues among Catholics and more cohesion between Catholic and the non-Catholic Christian world on health care.  \n\nThe \"freedom\" of bishops is a loss of freedom for those who work for them.  This isn't going to work.  There is an absolute lack of respect for those who work for Catholic organizations in the bishop's viewpoint about what they should be able to control.  \n\nI won't support Catholic hospitals or nursing homes.

Until blacks and whites start looking honestly at what has happened to a rather large sub-part of the black race in America, black men will continue their tragic trajectory to life in prison.

Coptic Christians are the original population of Egypt---pre-Arab and pre-Muslim----and have no connection with European imperialism post 1500.  And their history of being violently suppressed goes back a long way.  So, for example, back in the 8th and 9th century, when they were still the majority in Egypt, there were many revolts by the Copts against their Arab conquerors that were brutally suppressed. Discriminatory taxation was one of the causes.  (The Coptic Church hierarchy, which was granted a position of privilege by their Arab overlords, sometimes aided the suppression. ) History is written by the conquerors, and it doesn't much matter whether the conqueror is a 19th century European or an 8th century Arab..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

I teach Catechism, I prepare those preparing for Confirmation and am very active in a Catholic school for 20 years.  SO I am very Catholic, and Pope Ratzinger is my guy.  Francis has great teachings on helping the poor and servitude, but he has lost it.  He has become a Puppet for the globalist and the global warming folks.  \"WHom am I to judge a gay priest.\",  Divorced Catholics who remarry can recieve Holy Communion, and all the global warming nonsense is getting ridiculous.

Otto von  Bismarck is believed to have said, \"it is better that ten innocent men suffer than one guilty man escape.\" \n\nI know nothing about the men personally, but Burke et al seem to find the thought of the divorced and remarried going to communion to be personally offensive. Personally, I find the attitude of refusing mercy to be offensive.\n\nOn another wholly unrelated subject, you praised my son for \"respecting the law\" on divorce an remarriage. He does not respect that law. He LEFT the Catholic Church because of that law. It would be like saying that Jews who left Germany in the 1930s \"respected\" the Nuremberg Laws..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

And Facebook is totally there for you!\n\nAt the end of the day, Facebook is a business and their product is YOU, the user. They will take any money they can from advertisers, because that is their business - selling access to you. So if you are a Nazi, they will market that.

If one wants to avoid an abusive relationship, stay far away from those who are overly ambitious to the point where they step on everyone in order to advance their careers. Stay away from those who have a history of violence, especially towards those who are weaker than them, whether it's animals, children or the homeless. If one finds themselves in such a situation, get out ASAP, for the longer one stays in such a relationship, the worse it tends to get. If one threatens to kill someone for leaving--what's going to prevent this control freak from doing the same if she stays, other than her complete subserviance to his twisted desire to control every aspect of her existence?.\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

This still stands today, and Francis could wipe it out with a stroke of his pen today.  But he has not.  Look up 'Pontifical Secret'.\n\nFurther, why should a man not take more than one vow?  What is wrong with the married state?  What is wrong with sex in a committed relationship? What is sinful enough to suggest death of the soul?  Forever.  The priestly vow of celibacy is only a church discipline.  Like not eating meat on a Friday.  That discipline has been abolished, so why not the celibacy one?   God/Jesus never suggested  that \"mortal sin\" exists.

Why hold one religion to a different set of standards than another? The Muslim bakers did indeed discriminate and if you look all around everyone discriminates in some way, you discriminate everyday in some form of mannerism with the choices that you make even though you may not realize it. Sometimes you just got to let things slide by instead of trying to control and judge everything that comes up because you can't fight every injustice that occurs. So why is it ok for Muslims to discriminate and no one bats and eye, it barely makes headlines on B listed news sites but when a Christian does it, it becomes a national event just because someone you don't know was slighted and is it really a big deal that someone said \"Hey, can you do this for us?\" and the dude replied \"No.\".\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

I heard a Christian friend voted for Mr. Trump simply because \"I always vote Republican,\" without thinking about the issues. Another voted for Trump simply because of his dubious pro-life stance: dubious because he has been on both sides of the issue, and his attacks on women don't seem to me to be the attitude of a pro-lifer. What I find most incomprehensible about  Trump's support among evangelicals (80%) and white Catholics (60%), however,  is the free pass these Christians gave  him on his hateful comments. After thinking about those issues, I came to the conclusion that Jesus would not have voted for Mr. Trump.  But as Sister suggests, I think many  of Trump's Christian supporters did not think hard enough about their vote. I found it interesting that in the post-election days Hillary Clinton found it natural to quote Scripture; I cannot imagine Mr. Trump doing that..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

According to the doctrine of Primacy of Conscience no pope or bishop can oblige a priest or anyone to act against his conscience and do what he considers to be evil. I believe that this was St Thomas's original concept on this question. Therefore, no priest can be obliged by his bishop to give Communion to those whom he considers in conscience to be living in an adulterous relationship if he believes it would be sinful for him to do so. Current interpretation of Primacy of Conscience can work both ways.\nNaturally I disagree with you that the teaching of the Church is just rules. Love of God is paramount, an absolute. We are counselled to love our neighbour as we love ourselves an injunction which is relative.\nNice to see you back here and have a happy and holy Christmas..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

I would think the requirement that the church comes up with a system to investigate any new cases immediately and ways to deal with the issue when it comes up instead of covering it up need to be part of the suit. Training for everyone who works in the Catholic Church should also be required. It is not only  important for the church to reconize the abuse, admit to how bad it was and that they purposely covered it up, but that programs and policies are put into place to stop this from happening again or deal with it in a timely manners when does happen..\n\nPlease predict whether the comment is toxic or not:",

Teach our children, from pre-school on up, how to make money with money, playing the stock exchange game. That is probably the only way we will make education worthwhile in village schools.

However, I don't see why you would have to give up the Catholic faith if it happens, since the male-only priesthood has never been infallibly defined as a divinely revealed dogma and therefore is *NOT* a matter of faith.  \n\nI am no questioning JP2's authority to decree a hiatus.   I am not giving up the Catholic faith.  But a decree to officially stop discussing a doctrine, no matter how forcefully phrased, is *NOT* a dogma.  The doctrine will be clarified in due course.  We'll see what happens when we finally arrive in \"Tipperary.\"\n\nHowever, I strongly disagree that people should be intimidated into thinking that a reformable doctrine is irreformable.  Other than dogmas, all doctrines are admixtures of revealed truth and fallible human interpretation; and are, therefore, amenable to clarification.\n\nDue to deeply ingrained cultural conditioning, it is a visceral issue.

Jews demoralised America over the last 100 years with Satanic Qabalist Hollywood. They RAPE our children. Their music \"industry\" screams modern slavery. Besides this TRUTH.... Why fight JEW Battles? Whites and Blacks usually get along... The Crypto-Jews ran the transatlantic slave trade. So why are White non-slave owner Americans in 2017 under attack? One answer.... Devious Evil JEWS.\n\nDon't be fooled.... I am a Jewish anti-semite. I like being an anti-semite.
